  PVP the result of evaluating the following (paying special attention to the
  more-than-syntactic difference between the \lsquo{}starless\rsquo{} form of =let= and the
  \lsquo{}star-suffixed\rsquo{} form):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) (+ a b c))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) [+ a b c d])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [+ a b c d]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (+ 4)) (+ a b c +))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

***  When a variable is left undefined or it is marked as "unbounded", an expression trying 
***  to evaluate that undefined or unbound variable will simply fail and return a void error message. In terms of the difference
***  between let and let*, let* will bind the value to that variable immediately following the computing of its local value. This means
***  that if (a 1), its value cannot be changed later in the program.
** TODO TEJ
  A function-as-association between elements of a domain and elements of a
  codomain, for \ldquo{}small\rdquo domains and codomains, inspired so-called \ldquo{}association
  lists\rdquo (or alists) and the =assoc= (and associated) functions.

  =(assoc KEY LIST)= returns non-nil if KEY is \ldquo{}equal\rdquo to the first element of
  an element of LIST. The value is actually the first element of LIST whose
  first element equals KEY.

  For example, here is a function that uses an alist to look up the RGB values
  of a given color name:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun lookup-rgb (color-name)
    (rest (assoc color-name
                 '(("red" 255 0 0) ("green" 0 255 0) ("blue" 0 0 255)))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "blue")
#+END_SRC

: (0 0 255)

  What if the color name is not in the alist?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "grue")
#+END_SRC

: nil

  There are several variations of =assoc=. Find and give examples of using them.

** TODO WFK
  In the function-as-map context, here is another interpretation:

  A \ldquo{}map\rdquo type (AKA associative array, AKA hashtable) is found in many
  languages. For example, C++:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output
  #include <iostream>
  #include <map>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
     map<string, string> mymap;

     mymap["one"] = "red";
     mymap["two"] = "blue";
     mymap["three"] = "green";

     for (auto const &ent1 : mymap) {
        cout << ent1.first << " : " << ent1.second << endl;
     }
  }
#+END_SRC

: one : red
: three : green
: two : blue

  And python:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  mymap = {}

  mymap["one"] = "red"
  mymap["two"] = "blue"
  mymap["three"] = "green"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
          for key in mymap.keys():
                  print key + " : " + str(mymap[key])
#+END_SRC

: three : green
: two : blue
: one : red

  And of course elisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
  (let* ((mymap (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))
    (puthash "one" "red" mymap)
    (puthash "two" "blue" mymap)
    (puthash "three" "green" mymap)
    (pp (list (gethash "one" mymap)
              (gethash "two" mymap)
              (gethash "three" mymap)))
    (maphash (lambda (key value) (princ (format "%s : %s\n" key value))) mymap))
#+END_SRC

: ("red" "blue" "green")
: one : red
: two : blue
: three : green

  What happens if you omit the =:test 'equal= parameters to the
  =make-hash-table= call?

  This exercise explores /looping/ versus /mapping/.

  What does the =morphify= function defined below do? Think about it, then PVP
  the result of the call to it that follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphify (fun lst)
    (loop for item in lst
          collect (funcall fun item)))
#+END_SRC

  Note the quotes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (morphify (quote downcase) (quote ("THIS" "IS" "TOO" "LOUD")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
(this is too loud)

  The =morphify= function is essentially a /mapping/ function, which means it
  takes a passed-in function (=fun=) and a passed-in list (=lst=), and /maps fun
  over lst/, i.e., the results of calling the function =fun= on each element of
  the list =lst= are collected into a new list, which is returned.

  This shows one way (iteratively) a /map/ function could be implemented.
  Another way is /recursively/, as in:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphifyr (fun lst)
    (if (null lst)
        nil
      (append (list (funcall fun (first lst))) (morphifyr fun (rest lst)))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(morphifyr (quote downcase) (quote ("THIS" "IS" "GREAT")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| this | is | great |

  Explain how this version of =morphify= works.
  
*** Morphifyr works recursively by accepting a list as a the parameter and it then checks its base case,
*** if the first item in the list is empty or null (it then returns nil). Otherwise, it will append the first item of the 
*** list to a new list and then morphifyr calls itself again with the remaining items in the list. Essentially, what the function
*** does is accept a list, appends the first item to a new slot in the new list, calls itself again with the remaining
*** list items (from original list), and repeats until the base case is hit (the first item in the list is empty). The new list is then returned.
** TODO TGE
  Note the difference if -13 is used instead of 13 below:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun compute-floor-the-hard-way (dividend divisor)
    (- (/ dividend (float divisor)) (/ (mod dividend divisor) (float divisor))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (let* ((number (/ 13 4.0))
         (floor1 (floor number))
         (floor2 (compute-floor-the-hard-way 13 4.0)))
    (list number floor1 floor2))
#+END_SRC

: (3.25 3 3.0)

  Is the hard way correct?

  Graph the floor and ceiling functions f(x) = \lfloor{}x\rfloor and f(x) = \lceil{}x\rceil for real
  number values of x in the interval [-5.0 .. 5.0].
  
*** Your answer goes here.
** TODO WKM
  Which of these statements about floor and ceiling are correct, for any real
  number $x$ and any integers $n$ and $m$?
  1. $x - 1 < \lfloor{}x\rfloor \le x \le \lceil{}x\rceil < x + 1$.
  2. $\lfloor{}-x\rfloor = -\lceil{}x\rceil$.
  3. $\lceil{}-x\rceil = -\lfloor{}x\rfloor$.
  4. $\lfloor{}x + n\rfloor = \lfloor{}x\rfloor + n$.
  5. $\lceil{}x + n\rceil = \lceil{}x\rceil + n$.
  6. $\lfloor{}\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + \lceil{}\frac{n}{2}\rceil = n$.
  7. $\lfloor{}\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + \lfloor{}\frac{n + 1}{2}\rfloor = n$.
  8. $\lceil{}\frac{n}{2}\rceil + \lceil{}\frac{n + 1}{2}\rceil = n$.
  9. $\lfloor{}\frac{n + m}{2}\rfloor + \lceil{}\frac{n - m + 1}{2}\rceil = n$ (for any $m$, not just $m =
     0$ as in statement 7).
  10. $\lceil{}\frac{n + m}{2}\rceil + \lceil{}\frac{n - m + 1}{2}\rceil = n$ (for any $m$, not just $m =
      0$ as in statement 8).

** TODO TIW

  Define the function \ldquo{}round to nearest integer\rdquo using the floor and ceiling
  functions, together with the \ldquo{}Iverson bracket\rdquo function. (A number whose
  fractional part is less than one-half should be rounded down, otherwise up.)

  Identify the formula or rule that generates the terms of each sequence:
  1. =[7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 ...]= 7 * n
  2. =[7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43 ...]= n + 4
  3. =[3 4 6 9 13 18 24 31 39 48 ...]= The difference between list items is n = n+1 (Increments by 1 each time). So, if m = previous r = result, 
  (m + (n+1)) = r, etc.
  4. =[1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 ...]= List all of the possible binary combinations, then add another bit, list all of the possible
     binary combinations, repeat...
  5. =[1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 ...]= add previous 2 numbers, then add the result to the next number (1 + 1 = 2.
  6. =[7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 ...]=
  7. =[2 1 3 4 7 11 18 29 47 76 ...]=
  8. =[6 12 24 48 96 192 384 768 1536 3072 ...]=
  9. =[6 18 54 162 486 1458 4374 13122 39366 118098 ...]=
  10. =[2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 ...]=
*** 1. 7 * n
*** 2. n + 4
*** 3. The difference between list items is n = n + 1 (Increments by 1 each time). So, if m = previous and r = result,
***    (m + (n + 1)) = r, etc. with the count (n) incrementing by 1 for each successive result)
*** 4. The rule is to replace each digit of a number with a 1, starting on the right and moving to the left, having each '1' replacement
***    being the next value in the list. Then, once the digit has been tested for all '1' slots (the last input being all 1's), then
***    another digit is added and all of those inputs are tested with '1' values from right to left.
*** 5. Add 2 numbers, then add that result to the next number to produce a new result, add that new result to the next number to
***    produce the next result, etc. (1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 8 = 13, and so on).
*** 6. Add 2 numbers and add 1, then divide that result by 2, and repeat ( 14 + 7 + 1 = 22, 22 / 2 = 11, 22 + 11 + 1 = 34, 34 / 2 = 17, and so on). 
*** 7. Add 2 numbers, then add that result with the second input number (from previous two inputs) to produce a new result, add that new result to second input of 
***    the previous two inputs, and repeat. (2 + 1 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 3 + 4 = 7, and so on).
*** 8. n * 2. Multiply number by 2. That result will be the next number in the list. Repeat.
*** 9. n * 3. Multiply number by 3. That result will be the next number in the list. Repeat.
*** 10. The rule is that the list is all prime numbers in ascending order.
